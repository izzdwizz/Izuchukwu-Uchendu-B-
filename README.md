Version control
This is a mechanism for tracking changes to files across time. It enables several contributors to collaborate on a project while retaining a history of changes. Version control allows users to go back to prior states, work on many branches at the same time, and smoothly combine changes.

Difference between Git and GitHub:

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to source code during software development.
GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts software development projects and serves as a centralized repository for version control using Git. It builds upon Git by providing a web-based graphical interface, issue tracking, and other collaboration capabilities.

GitHub alternatives:

GitLab: Provides a web-based Git repository manager with CI/CD pipeline functionality.

Bitbucket: Hosts Git and Mercurial repositories with integration features.

SourceForge: A web-based platform that provides version control, bug tracking, and collaborative features.

What is the difference between Git Fetch and Git Pull?

Git Fetch: Transfers changes from a remote repository to your local repository without merging them. It refreshes your local references without changing your working directory.
Git Pull fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch. It updates both your local references and the working directory.

Git Rebase
Git Rebase is a command that combines multiple commits into a new base commit. Simply put, it allows you to modify the base of your branch, which is commonly used to have a neater and more linear commit history.

Git Cherry-Pick:
Git cherry-pick is a command used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It allows you to pick a commit and apply it to another branch, useful when you want to selectively bring changes from one branch to another.
